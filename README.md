# refactored-memory

Name's Xerxes. Likes coding/programming and coming up with strange video game mechanics. 

There will be ideas that I think are cool or fun from a video game design perspective or just technology in general.
Those ideas will be logged here.




I also like large spacing between paragraphs.
